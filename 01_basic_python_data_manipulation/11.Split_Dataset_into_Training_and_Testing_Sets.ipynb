    "\n",
    "This problem asks me to split a dataset into training and testing sets.  \n",
    "In machine learning, models are trained on training data and evaluated on unseen testing data to measure performance.  \n",
    "To solve this problem, I will divide the dataset based on a given ratio, such as 80% for training and 20% for testing.  \n",
    "This helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well.\n",

    "\n",
    "By solving this problem, I learned how datasets are split for training and evaluation in machine learning.  \n",
    "I understood why separating training and testing data is important to avoid data leakage.  \n",
    "This problem helped me think about real ML workflows instead of isolated calculations.  \n",
    "Train-test splitting is one of the first steps before building any machine learning model.  \n",
    "Next, I want to learn how to shuffle data randomly before splitting.\n"
