    "\n",
    "This problem asks me to calculate the dot product of two lists (vectors).  \n",
    "The dot product is an important mathematical operation used in data science and machine learning, especially in linear regression, similarity measures, and neural networks.  \n",
    "To solve this problem, I will multiply corresponding elements from both lists and then sum all the results.  \n",
    "This helps me understand how vector-based calculations work at a low level.\n",

    "\n",
    "By solving this problem, I learned how dot products are computed using basic Python logic.  \n",
    "I understood how vector operations are connected to machine learning algorithms like linear regression.  \n",
    "This problem helped me think in terms of mathematical operations on data rather than just simple lists.  \n",
    "Understanding dot products is essential for working with weights, features, and similarity calculations.  \n",
    "Next, I want to explore how this logic is used inside ML models.\n"
