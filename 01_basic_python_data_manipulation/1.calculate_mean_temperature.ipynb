    "\n",
    "This problem asks me to find the average temperature from a list of daily temperatures.  \n",
    "To solve this, I need to add all the temperature values together and then divide the sum by the total number of temperatures.  \n",
    "I will also round the result to one decimal place to make it easier to read.  \n",
    "This is important because calculating averages is a basic and common task in data science when summarizing data.\n",

    "\n",
    "By solving this problem, I practiced looping through a list and doing arithmetic calculations in Python.  \n",
    "I also learned how to use the `round()` function to format numbers.  \n",
    "This problem helped me understand how to manipulate basic data structures, which is a foundation for working with datasets.  \n",
    "In real projects, calculating averages is useful for quickly understanding data trends and making decisions.  \n",
    "Next, I want to try solving similar problems but with more complex data or conditions.\n"
