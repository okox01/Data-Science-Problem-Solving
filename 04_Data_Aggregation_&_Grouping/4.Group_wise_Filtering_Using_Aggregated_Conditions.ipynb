    "\n",
    "In real-world datasets, I often don’t want to keep **all groups** after aggregation.  \n",
    "Instead, I may want to **filter groups based on some condition**, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Departments with average salary above a threshold\n",
    "- Categories with enough data points\n",
    "- Groups that meet business or ML criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, I will filter departments **only if their average salary is above 65,000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because filtering at the group level helps in:\n",
    "- Removing weak signals\n",
    "- Keeping meaningful patterns\n",
    "- Improving model quality\n",

    "3. How group-level logic improves dataset quality\n",
    "4. Why this technique is useful before feature engineering or modeling\n",

    "- Business analytics\n",
    "- ML data preprocessing\n",
    "- Removing weak categories\n",
    "- Dataset optimization\n",

    "This problem reflects **strong Pandas knowledge + analytical decision-making**, which is important for Data Science and ML profiles.\n",
